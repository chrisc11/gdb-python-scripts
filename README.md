This repo will hopefully eventually hold a collection of useful gdb-python scripts for debug.

If you don't know much about GDBs python scripting API check out [this writeup](https://github.com/chrisc11/debug-tips/blob/master/gdb/python-linked-list.md)!

PS: I tried to search the interwebs first for a pre-existing implementation for commands added but
could not find anything. If you know of a repo that provides similar functionality for any of the
command you see, do let me know!
